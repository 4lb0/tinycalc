# ðŸ§® tiny calc

A simple calculator in your browser, because your browser is always open

Because I'm tiring of using Google as a calculator plus I don't like the
calculator in my OS.

Make sure to add it as a search engine. I prefer the `=` keyword.
**Don't forget to press space after =**.

Don't worry, it works offline.

## Some tips

* The multiple operator is `*`, example for 2 Ã— 4
write [2\*4](https://tinycalc.app/#2*4)
* The divition operator is `/`, example for 15 Ã· 3
write [15/3](https://tinycalc.app/#15%2F3)
* The power operator is `^`, example for 3Â²
write [3^2](https://tinycalc.app/#3^2)
* Use parenthesis `()`, like in ((3+2)\*(10-3))/4
write [((3+2)*(10-3))/4](https://tinycalc.app/#%28%283%2B2%29*%2810-3%29%29%2F4)
